\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [x] add old list parsing into make\+List.\+py
\item [x] modify make\+List to accept arguments
\item [x ] verify operation in binary (rts/non-\/rts) mode
\item [ ] verify operation in categorical mode
\item [x ] add flags in \doxyref{Settings.\+py}{p.}{settings_8py} to allow the \doxyref{make\+Data\+Sets}{p.}{namespacemake_data_sets} to change how the model is fit i.\+e. the switch between \textquotesingle{}binary\+\_\+crossentropy\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}categorical\+\_\+crossentropy\textquotesingle{}
\item [ ] Change testing data to old dataset for now
\item [ ] split model training into primary (rts/nrts) and secondary (\{m,e,g\}rts/nrts) models
\item [ ] in orignal version verify if categorical accuracy is as high as binary via the code snippet Code snippit\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
from keras.metrics import categorical\_accuracy
model.compile(loss='binary\_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=[categorical\_accuracy])
\end{DoxyCode}

\item [ ] Update the main todo list by the list below\+: {\tt https\+://gist.\+github.\+com/gravetaxon/67c2891f5d665f07589fae576b802ee6}
\item [ ] Verify that the output D\+E\+N\+SE function is of the correct for multi-\/class operations.

RE\+: Meeting May 9th\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [ ] Add amplitude calculations for a graph
\item [ ] Train multiple models\+: N v N, R v N, M v N, E v N
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [ ] Compare output relative to actual graphs (human vs models)
\item [ ] Use voter model to ident which of the categories match best
\item [ ] For R\+T\+S-\/\+Ident graphs use amp calc to determine the quantity of specific amplitutde ranges
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item [X ] modify model voting to allow for non perfect matches (mp[0]==0 =$>$ this pix is 100\% a R\+TS graph) [ low$\ast$cat\+Num $<$ mp[0] $<$ high$\ast$cat\+Num ] where cat\+Num has value of 0 for rts graphs, 1 for non-\/rts, 2+ for other categories
